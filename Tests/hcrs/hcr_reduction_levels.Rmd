##Setup/Assumptions
Experiment: The purpose of this experiment is to systematically test the effectiveness of different harvest control controls in the face of climate change. So, we will be assessing how well a fishery does over time if the harvest control is reducing F by 5%, 10%, 15%, etc., and if those differences are significant.

The "assessment" period of FishE in this model is every 10 years.
The error in the F/Fmsy ratio is .1.
The harvest control rules (5% - 50% reduction) will be tested over a range of climate impacts.

Assumptions: 
 - Fisheries represented in the model have no current management. Initial biomass in the simulation is therefore representative of the equilibrium that the fishery has reached over the years due to some level of fishing mortality (f). 
 - Fishing mortality and f/fmsy ratios are calculated at the beginning of each year and the change in f is applied to fishing in that same year
 - The current f at the beginning of the simulation is reached when catch is equivalent to the surplus production of the fishery at that biomass. 
 - The f calculated at the beginning of the simulation is the true fishing mortality rate of the operating fishery. 
 - Climate change is affecting the productivity of fish stocks by influeing the growth term (r)
 - The f that comes out of the HCR is the actual f in the fishery moving forward (fisherman are adhering to that f)
 
Goal: Simulate the initial use of FISHE if it is only applied on 20 year intervals, focusing on the Inital Stock Assessment step of the process, with climate change reducing productivity. 
 


##Model

Before running the model run the following code:
```{r setup}

#create an interval vector for times that we do want to do the assessment:
assess_int <- seq(5,100,5)

#Write a "not contained in" function"
`%not_in%` <- purrr::negate(`%in%`)
```

A note about the HCR and f: the HCR decision must be applied to f in the first year otherwise f and biomass will remain constant until year 20 when the next assessment is applied. 
```{r model}

#Baseline model with error around the f_ratio (f/fmsy) and no repetition of the stock assessment process for the duration of the simulation:
