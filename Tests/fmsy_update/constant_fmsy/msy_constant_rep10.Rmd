##Setup/Assumptions

Experiment: In this experiment we are testing the importance of updating estimates of Fmsy to reflect productivity changes. We will compare the number of times managers make the correct decision about the harvest control rule when the assessment includes an update of Fmsy and when it does not. 

The "assessment" period of FishE in this model is every 10 years.

In this experiment, the true Fmsy is adjusting over time as climate change alters productivity. However, the management decision is based on a Fmsy that is not adjusted to climate change - it is based on the initial Fmsy that would be calculated in the year 1 assessment. 

The error in the F/Fmsy ratio is .1 - this reflects Tier 3 in FISHE where the fishery has more than one year of data available.

The harvest control rule is:
  - f_ratio < 1 increase f by 5%
  - f_ratio == 1 f remains the same as previous year
  - 1 < f_ratio < 2 f decreases by 10%
  - f_ratio > 2 fishery shuts down (f goes to 0)
    Note: In this simulation there is no reopening of fisheries once the manager decides to shut them down


Assumptions:
  - Actual Fmsy is changing with climate change
  - Fisheries represented in the model have no current management. Initial biomass in the simulation is therefore representative of the equilibrium that the fishery has reached over the years due to some level of fishing mortality (f). 
  - Fishing mortality and f/fmsy ratios are calculated at the beginning of each year and the change in f is applied to fishing in that same year
  - The current f at the beginning of the simulation is reached when catch is equivalent to the surplus production of the fishery at that biomass. 
  - The f calculated at the beginning of the simulation is the true fishing mortality rate of the operating fishery. 
  - Climate change is affecting the productivity of fish stocks by influeing the growth term (r)
  - The f that comes out of the HCR is the actual f in the fishery moving forward (fisherman are adhering to that f)
 

##Model

Before running the model run the following code:
```{r model-setup}

#create an interval vector for times that we do want to do the assessment:
assess_int <- seq(10,100,10)

#Write a "not contained in" function"
`%not_in%` <- purrr::negate(`%in%`)
```

 
```{r model}
