##Setup/Assumptions
Experiment: The purpose of this experiment is to systematically test the effectiveness of reassessing a fishery using the FishE process on different time intervals.

The "assessment" period of FishE in this model is every 5 years.

In this experiment, the true Fmsy is adjusting over time as climate change alters productivity. The management decision is also based on a Fmsy that is adjusting with climate change.

The error in the F/Fmsy ratio is .3.

The test will cover a range of climate impacts, initial growth rates, and initial biomasses, with a 10% reduction hcr.

Assumptions: 
 - Fisheries represented in the model have no current management. Initial biomass in the simulation is therefore representative of the equilibrium that the fishery has reached over the years due to some level of fishing mortality (f). 
 - Fishing mortality and f/fmsy ratios are calculated at the beginning of each year and the change in f is applied to fishing in that same year
 - The current f at the beginning of the simulation is reached when catch is equivalent to the surplus production of the fishery at that biomass. 
 - The f calculated at the beginning of the simulation is the true fishing mortality rate of the operating fishery. 
 - Climate change is affecting the productivity of fish stocks by influeing the growth term (r)
 - The f that comes out of the HCR is the actual f in the fishery moving forward (fisherman are adhering to that f)
 
Goal: Simulate the effect of different assessment intervals in the face of climate change.
 


##Model

Before running the model run the following code:
```{r setup}

#create an interval vector for times that we do want to do the assessment:
assess_int <- seq(5, 100, 5)

#Write a "not contained in" function"
`%not_in%` <- purrr::negate(`%in%`)
```

A note about the HCR and f: the HCR decision must be applied to f in the first year otherwise f and biomass will remain constant until year 5 when the next assessment is applied. 
```{r model}

#Baseline model with error around the f_ratio (f/fmsy) and repetition of the assessment process every 5 years for the duration of the simulation:

  results$f_ratio_p[1] = results$f_ratio[1] #this is the perceived f ratio by the fisheries managers - with climate change, this perceived ratio will adjust fmsy as climate shifts productivity
