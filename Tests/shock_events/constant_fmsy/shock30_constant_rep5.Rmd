##Setup/Assumptions

Experiment: In this experiment we are testing the impact of shock events (El Nino years) on fisheries management. We will compare the number of times managers make the correct decision about the harvest control rule when random shock events are included. 

The "assessment" period of FishE in this model is every 5 years.

In this experiment, the true Fmsy is adjusting over time as climate change alters productivity. However, the management decision is based on a Fmsy that is not adjusted to climate change - it is based on the initial Fmsy that would be calculated in the year 1 assessment. 

The error in the F/Fmsy ratio is .3 - this reflects Tier 2 in FISHE where the fishery has one year of data available.

The harvest control rule is:
  - f_ratio < 1 increase f by 5%
  - f_ratio == 1 f remains the same as previous year
  - 1 < f_ratio < 2 f decreases by 10%
  - f_ratio > 2 fishery shuts down (f goes to 0)
    Note: In this simulation there is no reopening of fisheries once the manager decides to shut them down

Shock events:
  - There is a 20% chance that any given year is an El Nino year (1/5 year frequency) 
  - During an El Nino year the productivity of the fishery decreases by 30%

Assumptions:
  - Actual Fmsy is changing with climate change
  - Fisheries represented in the model have no current management. Initial biomass in the simulation is therefore representative of the equilibrium that the fishery has reached over the years due to some level of fishing mortality (f). 
  - Fishing mortality and f/fmsy ratios are calculated at the beginning of each year and the change in f is applied to fishing in that same year
  - The current f at the beginning of the simulation is reached when catch is equivalent to the surplus production of the fishery at that biomass. 
  - The f calculated at the beginning of the simulation is the true fishing mortality rate of the operating fishery. 
  - Climate change is affecting the productivity of fish stocks by influeing the growth term (r)
  - The f that comes out of the HCR is the actual f in the fishery moving forward (fisherman are adhering to that f)
 
 ##Model

Before running the model run the following code:
```{r model-setup}

#create an interval vector for times that we do want to do the assessment:
assess_int <- seq(5,100,5)

#Write a "not contained in" function"
`%not_in%` <- purrr::negate(`%in%`)
```

 
```{r model}

##Fmsy is updating with climate change but managers are NOT updating perceived Fmsy

Run the model:
```{r run}
