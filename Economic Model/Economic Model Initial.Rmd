Goal: We want to optimize the present value of fisheries profits (prof) by altering the harvest rule (Y) subject to the constraints of the dynamic growth of the fishery.

Using the fundamental equation of renewable resources (from Nat Resource Econ textbook), we can solve this optimization by solving for F'(B) in the following equation:

$F'(B) + (partial~derivative~of~prof/B)/(partial~derivative~of~prof/Y) = discount~rate(disc)$

Where:
$F(B) =
